# AI Lab -- 8 puzzle


This is the base repository for the 8-puzzle lab.
The code provides an initial implementation of the 8-puzzle problem, but is missing some key components. Your goal is to complete the implementation and solve the 8-puzzle problem.

You can find the instructions on the [course website](https://arbimo.github.io/insa-4ir-artificial-intelligence/labs/puzzle.html).


## Getting started

The project is a Rust project, and you will need to have Rust installed on your machine to run it.

- Run tests (expected to fail at first): `cargo test`
- Run main (debug/slow): `cargo run`
- Run main (release/fast): `cargo run --release`
